abstract = {Abstract The comparative analysis of the population variation patterns exhibited by different types of information has long been a genuine anthropological/genetic preoccupation. One of the generic problems attracting repeated attention is the connection between genetic and cultural consequences of population isolation; we expect both patterns and amounts of variation to reflect the same history of group fission and fusion, but what do we see in practice? Numerous techniques have been employed in such work, all based on comparison of different matrices of pairwise distanceslaffinities. A basic difficulty with all of these methods is that the N(N – 1) pairwise elements of an (N × N) matrix cannot be mutually independent. Recently, a versatile test of matrix correlation that allows for this fact, originally developed by Mantel but since extensively modified and extended, has gained popularity in anthropology, as well as geography, ecology, sociology, psychometrics, population biology, and systematics. We present here a general framework for many of these efforts, based on the Mantel test, and then illustrate its use with four examples from our own work and that of our colleagues: (a) genetic affinity and migrational separation in the Bainwa, (b) clinal versus cluster variation in the Yanomama, (c) genetic, linguistic, and geographic affinities among the Chibcha-speaking tribes, and (d) migration and genetic affinity in the Gainj and Kalam. The technique is nonparametric and so general that it is useful for many different types of pattern comparison, even when the connections between different types of information are poorly understood. Greater analytic potential is generally realized when there are definite theoretical connections between the patterns being compared. With theoretical care and a bit of imagination, one can combine the advantages of parametric assumptions with the robustness of nonparametric analysis. Novel analyses and anthropological opportunities are emerging continuously. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The data matrix lists the presences and absences of taxa in samples. The strategy is to generate a unidimensional sequence by rearranging the taxa and samples so that the presences are blocked along the matrix diagonal. The method is illustrated with two case studies from the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group of New York. The first represents a regressive interval and the seriation sequence summarizes the changes in fauna and samples which can be explained by falling sea level. The second example embraces a much wider range of variation. Seriation mainly recovers a first‐order pattern related to depth and correlated variables. This seriation does not reveal parameters such as the nature of the substrate, turbidity, habitat stability and distance offshore. These data cannot be reduced to one dimension. In all cases, seriation yields results similar to those of cluster analysis and the first axis of multivariate ordinations frequently used by ecologists and paleoecologists},

 volume={11}, 
 ISSN={1866-9565}, 
 DOI={10.1007/s12520-018-0742-3}, 
 abstractNote={Understanding the patterns that result from intercommunity contact has long been an interest in anthropology. Although linguistically diverse, peoples of the Historic-period Great Plains came into contact through a diversity of means, both malevolent and benevolent in form. Accordingly, the idea that the Plains was an environment that led to high degrees of cultural interchange has long been held. Recently, it has been proposed that the among-tribe distribution of some material culture patterns, such as beadwork patterns on moccasins, is explicable in geographic terms. That is, geographically proximate groups exchanged cultural features at higher rates than those more geographically distant from each other. While logically sound, this pattern would only emerge at statistically significant levels if selective biases were not operating to prevent the “free flow” of information. However, there are viable and well-documented reasons why decorative features may be subject to such cultural selection. Moreover, previous assessments of the geographic hypothesis only examined the general layout of beadwork designs, rather than more detailed features such as motifs, beadwork techniques, and other decorative features. Here, the role of geographic spacing in explaining the among-tribe distribution of beadwork attributes on the High Plains during the Historic period is reexamined. A dataset describing motifs, beadwork techniques, and additional decorative features is used. These data are subjected to several sets of statistical analysis. The role of linguistic affinities is also considered. The results show that geographic “isolation by distance” does indeed explain the distribution of beadwork attributes among these ethnolinguistically diverse tribes, with no equivalent statistical effect for language patterns. In turn, these results highlight the role of specific processes operating among these communities. These results also underline the value of ethnographic museum collections for addressing the role of social processes among the people responsible for their manufacture, which can have anthropological relevance over much broader scales.},

They are relational in that it is the ties between actors (or nodes) that define social connections. Archaeologists are currently employing a diversity of theoretical approaches to networks, and the perspective taken in this review is that SNA can provide insights into a number of different social processes using different theories. Following a brief historical overview, I discuss two aspects of SNA: the structural position of the actor or node, and characterizations of whole networks. I then summarize several broad classes of archaeological networks: historical, spatial, and material. I conclude with a call for more bridging approaches to span alternative theoretical and methodological approaches in the archaeology of networks.},

abstractNote={Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible “betweenness” measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

DOI={10.1371/journal.pone.0294111}, 
abstractNote={Storing information and circulating it between individuals and groups is a critical behaviour that signals a tipping point in our evolutionary history. Such practices enabled the preservation and consolidation of knowledge over extended periods, facilitating the accumulation of cultural innovations across generations. In this study, we used Social Network Analysis methods to explore how knowledge circulated during the transition to agriculture in the Western Mediterranean region. Previous studies have shown that specific elements of the material culture reveal distinct patterns of cultural interaction among early farming communities. Here, we investigated if two archaeological proxies, personal ornaments and pottery decorations, both with an exclusively symbolic function, reveal different network structures, and if the different degree of connexions acted equally on the transmission of styles, symbols, and network changes over time. Our results relied on cultural data recorded from 77 archaeological occupations covering Italy, France, and Spain, spanning over 1,500 years (ca. 7950~6450 cal BP). By utilizing a chronological dataset comprising 114 radiocarbon dates, we revealed that pottery decorative techniques networks exhibited stronger connexions over space and time, with nodes organized in clear cluster, when compared to personal ornaments networks. The findings highlight the regionalization and fragmentation of cultural networks during the Early Neolithic, and that the transmission of cultural traits within each category of artefact operated through varying cultural and social mechanisms. Pottery expressed a dynamic regional identity, continuously shaped by geographical and chronological proximity, while bead-type associations contributed to enduring identities shared across vast geographical scales. These networks shed light on the multifaceted shaping of social and symbolic capital among the Mediterranean’s early farmers, emphasizing the strength and quality of social ties that existed between communities and the level of reciprocity and cooperation required to foster these diverse social, economic, and cultural development strategies.},

abstractNote={The transition to farming is the process by which human groups switched from hunting and gathering wild resources to food production. Understanding how and to what extent the spreading of farming communities from the Near East had an impact on indigenous foraging populations in Europe has been the subject of lively debates for decades. Ethnographic and archaeological studies have shown that population replacement and admixture, trade, and long distance diffusion of cultural traits lead to detectable changes in symbolic codes expressed by associations of ornaments on the human body. Here we use personal ornaments to document changes in cultural geography during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. We submitted a binary matrix of 224 bead-types found at 212 European Mesolithic and 222 Early Neolithic stratigraphic units to a series of spatial and multivariate analyses. Our results reveal consistent diachronic and geographical trends in the use of personal ornaments during the Neolithisation. Adoption of novel bead-types combined with selective appropriation of old attires by incoming farmers is identified in Southern and Central Europe while cultural resistance leading to the nearly exclusive persistence of indigenous personal ornaments characterizes Northern Europe. We argue that this pattern reflects two distinct cultural trajectories with different potential for gene flow.},

DOI={10.1016/j.quaint.2017.01.039}, 
abstractNote={The making of images has played an important role in the functioning of prehistoric societies because it is a tool of communication that contributes to the stability of social groups. First and foremost, the image can serve as a form of visual support for the collective myths that form the basis of culture, but all forms of imagery, figurative and non-figurative, can serve as significant markers within a society. Members of traditional societies can be defined by their membership in a group (clan, lineage, social status, etc.), which can be made visible through graphic signs that are made according to more or less strict rules known by all members of the larger society. Such distinctive marks can be applied directly to the body of each individual (through body painting, tattooing, scarification), but they can also be reproduced on external surfaces (such as cave or rock walls), and thus acquire the status of a representative in absentia. It has been proposed at various times that these graphic expressions, generally called “signs,” constitute veritable “identity markers” that can be perceived at multiple levels. Within a group, they serve to signal the membership of each individual to a social status or category. In intergroup relationships, they can have a more general role as markers of territory or ethnicity (Leroi-Gourhan, 1981). Certain signs lend themselves particularly well to the social-markers hypothesis because they possess all of the characteristics required for this function. Such is the case of the quadrilateral signs from Upper Paleolithic contexts in the Cantabrian region, Spain. In the caves of El Castillo, La Pasiega, Altamira, and Las Chimeneas, relatively close together, we find groupings of signs that share a common quadrilateral structure but vary in terms of the arrangement of internal details. A formal analysis based on the method of correspondence analysis and other statistical tests reveals two primary groups based on these independent formal characteristics. This schema appears to the be product of a codified system that allows for a large number of variants with a high potential for distinction based on the flexible combination of a relatively small number of elements. These examples constitute a form of differential marking, of which numerous examples are known over time and across cultures, from the first modern humans to contemporary societies.},

DOI={10.1016/j.jas.2005.11.017}, 
abstractNote={Our knowledge of the migration routes of the first anatomically modern populations colonising the European territory at the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic, of their degree of biological, linguistic, and cultural diversity, and of the nature of their contacts with local Neanderthals, is still vague. Ethnographic studies indicate that of the different components of the material culture that survive in the archaeological record, personal ornaments are among those that best reflect the ethno-linguistic diversity of human groups. The ethnic dimension of beadwork is conveyed through the use of distinct bead types as well as by particular combinations and arrangements on the body of bead types shared with one or more neighbouring groups. One would expect these variants to leave detectable traces in the archaeological record. To explore the potential of this approach, we recorded the occurrence of 157 bead types at 98 European Aurignacian sites. Seriation, correspondence, and GIS analyses of this database identify a definite cline sweeping counter-clockwise from the Northern Plains to the Eastern Alps via Western and Southern Europe through fourteen geographically cohesive sets of sites. The sets most distant from each other include Aurignacian sites from the Rhône valley, Italy, Greece and Austria on the one hand, and sites from Northern Europe, on the other. These two macro-sets do not share any bead types. Both are characterised by particular bead types and share personal ornaments with the intermediate macro-set, composed of sites from Western France, Spain, and Southern France. We argue that this pattern, which is not explained by chronological differences between sites or by differences in raw material availability, reflects the ethnolinguistic diversity of the earliest Upper Palaeolithic populations of Europe.},

ISSN={0305-4403}, 
DOI={10.1016/j.jas.2015.05.003}, 
abstractNote={The Aurignacian typo-technological tradition has long been considered linked with the dispersal of anatomically Modern Humans over western Eurasia at the onset of the Upper Palaeolithic. In Europe it is commonly divided into two main phases, the Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian whose definitions is based on the typo-technological features of lithics and some osseous “markers” like the split-based points. The osseous industry has recurrently been cited as a major innovation signaling the transition from Middle to Early Upper Palaeolithic. Nevertheless, recent studies strongly suggest that the real innovation is antler working, as bone working has been found to be similar in the Mousterian and the Early Upper Palaeolithic. Riparo Mochi is among the key Western European sites for assessing the nature of shifts and continuities between the Proto- and Early Aurignacian phases of the technocomplex. These data are significant for the study of the distribution of the first anatomically Modern Humans in Eurasia owing to several factors: (1) preservation of the Proto- and Early Aurignacian levels; (2) their location along the likely southern dispersal route of the Aurignacian; (3) the richness of archaeological evidence; and (4) recent re-evaluation of their chrono-stratigraphy. The study of worked osseous remains allows us to establish the comparative characteristics of animal raw material exploitation within the Riparo Mochi Aurignacian. Results demonstrate that animal raw material exploitation increases from the bottom to the top of the archaeological sequence at this site. Hunting weapons, as well as personal ornaments other than those made on shells, are only present in Early Aurignacian layers. Antler working is not documented in the Proto-Aurignacian, which is consistent with the hypothesis of the appearance of antler hunting weapons only after the Heinrich Stadial 4 and Campanian Ignimbrite climatic events.},

ISSN={0305-4403}, 
DOI={10.1016/j.jas.2012.02.003}, 
abstractNote={Despite being at the heart of the question of the emergence of the European Upper Palaeolithic, the Aurignacian osseous industry is essentially known by the production of split-based points, ornaments and portable art whereas bone tools, usually dedicated to domestic tasks and with variable technical complexity, have been largely ignored. However, when the high number of unworked tools is included – i.e. bone fragments recovered from food processing and used directly as tools with no previous shaping phase – bone tools represent a significant proportion of the Early Aurignacian industry. Among these unworked tools, is a newly-discovered type: “unworked intermediate tools.” This article presents a detailed description based on taphonomic, typological and technological characters. It shows that these tools are diaphyseal fragments which are used directly as a wedge, very likely for woodworking and perhaps for antler processing. The processes behind the appearance of osseous technology at the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe are then discussed in light of this discovery and, more generally, the revised composition of the Early Aurignacian toolkit. The high proportion of unworked bone tools, a type more commonly associated with the Middle Palaeolithic, suggests a more gradual technological shift between Middle and Upper Palaeolithic than has previously been considered. As part of this hypothesis, the emergence of working osseous material could be due to a gradual transfer of techniques previously applied to wood, as others have proposed.},

DOI={10.1080/03122417.2016.1186345}, 
abstractNote={This paper explores inter-group signalling behaviour of hunter-fisher-gatherers living in arid and temperate coastal regions in Holocene Australia. We examine shield designs in the rock art of two visually similar engraved art provinces on opposite sides of the Australian continent: Port Hedland and Sydney. We explore the question of inter-group social signalling behaviour in arid versus fertile environments by testing the stylistic heterogeneity of shield designs in both art provinces. We examine the stylistic diversity of historically-collected and illustrated shields from both regions, and compare these with the engraved repertoires of the two style provinces. One of the precepts of information exchange theory (IET) is that publicly-displayed items/artefacts will provide the best vehicles for projecting cultural identity information. We assume that shields, as items of material culture which are carried publically, would have been ideally suited to signal individual, local and broader group identity. In more fertile areas it is usually argued that hunter-gatherers demonstrate increased territoriality and social boundedness as a result of demographic packing and focused resources, compared to groups in arid areas where there are widely ramified social networks. We test the hypothesis that a greater degree of stylistic heterogeneity should be displayed by engraved Sydney shields compared with those found in Port Hedland. However, our analyses demonstrate the reverse of this prediction. We suggest some alternative explanations for how style has been used in the arid coastal Pilbara, and suggest refinement is needed of some expectations in information exchange theory in arid zones where there is focalised resource availability and extreme language hybridity.},

The density of sites and more-or-less normalized products make possible an original spatial interpretation, that is probably unprecedented for Palaeolithic societies. Beyond highlighting the diffusion of some concepts over long distances, these rich data allow a deeper analysis of exchange, influence, and non-influence connections. Consequently, the question arises of the identification of what can be called “territories” (spaces built and delimited by human occupations) or “symbolic territories”. We define “symbolic territories” as spaces without visible material frontiers, symbolic through the weight of the ideas, the shared social norms and the installation of concepts by the societies in their close environment. We propose to examine this question through the prism of symbolic productions: body ornaments, portable art, rock art. Thousands of pieces of symbolic evidence assigned to the Magdalenian and a better stratigraphic definition for this period offer a favourable context for discussing the social implications of the results of several analyses: the distribution of themes in space, the presence of types of sign or figurative subjects contained in a narrow space, the identification of individual images and collective graphic norms. Comparing these approaches to series from the Middle and Upper Magdalenian, in which the evidence is the most abundant, will allow us to consider the nature of perceptible “territories”. Then we will question the relationships between human groups through identity and mechanisms of otherness in Magdalenian societies.},

 abstract = {This article suggests that accepted interpretations of variability in nonlithic material culture are insufficient. Recent ethnographic fieldwork in Kenya and Zambia and anthropological studies of societies in Sudan and Nigeria demonstrate that culture may be used by groups to communicate within-group corporateness in reference to outsiders. The greater the competition between groups for resources, the greater the likelihood that material culture will play a part in the maintenance of internal cohesion. Distinctive types of distributions and associations of artifacts occur as strains develop between spatially or hierarchically defined groups. The relevance of this view to archaeology is shown by two examples. Finally, it is suggested that this type of approach will allow a better understanding of the underlying causes of social and cultural change.},

The aim of the work is to understand more about the factors which cause variation in the structure of artefact distributions in order to enable the archaeologist better to understand his data from the past. It is shown that many of the usual interpretations of material culture patterning are inadequate because they do not take into account the ability of groups and individuals to use artefacts as a medium for the communication of information about, for example, one's membership of identity groups and status groups. The importance of the symbolic nature of artefacts for the structuring of material culture distributions is shown at the boundaries between spatial identity groups, and in the distributions of male-and female-associated items.},

DOI={https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.10.001}, 
abstractNote={The Aurignacian technocomplex comprises a succession of culturally distinct phases. Between its first two subdivisions, the Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian, we see a shift from single to separate reduction sequences for blade and bladelet production, the appearance of split-based antler points, and a number of other changes in stone tool typology and technology as well as in symbolic material culture. Bayesian modeling of available 14C determinations, conducted within the framework of this study, indicates that these material culture changes are coincident with abrupt and marked climatic changes. The Proto-Aurignacian occurs during an interval (ca. 41.5–39.9 k cal BP) of relative climatic amelioration, Greenland Interstadials (GI) 10 and 9, punctuated by a short cold stadial. The Early Aurignacian (ca. 39.8–37.9 k cal BP) predominantly falls within the climatic phase known as Heinrich Stadial (HS) 4, and its end overlaps with the beginning of GI 8, the former being predominantly characterized by cold and dry conditions across the European continent. We use eco-cultural niche modeling to quantitatively evaluate whether these shifts in material culture are correlated with environmental variability and, if so, whether the ecological niches exploited by human populations shifted accordingly. We employ genetic algorithm (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent) techniques to estimate the ecological niches exploited by humans (i.e., eco-cultural niches) during these two phases of the Aurignacian. Partial receiver operating characteristic analyses are used to evaluate niche variability between the two phases. Results indicate that the changes in material culture between the Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian are associated with an expansion of the ecological niche. These shifts in both the eco-cultural niche and material culture are interpreted to represent an adaptive response to the relative deterioration of environmental conditions at the onset of HS4.},

abstractNote={The Aurignacian occurred in the middle of the Last Glacial Period, in which climate underwent major changes on millennial time scales, highlighted by the Greenland interstadial and stadial periods. Here we investigate how climate change influenced the Aurignacian human dispersal in Europe and search for answers to several highly-debated questions in the Archaeology and Paleoanthropology. We use a global climate model to simulate the prototypical stadial and interstadial climate conditions and develop a human-existence potential (HEP) model to compute the probability of human existence by combining the climate data with archaeological site data. Using the HEP model, we reconstruct the patterns of human-existence probability and provide a pan-European overview of the Aurignacian human dispersal. The model results suggest that climate change significantly influences human dispersal, but there is evidence of human adaptation to climate. The Aurignacian dispersal is likely achieved in alternating modes of expansion and contraction. In comparison to interstadial times, human-existence probability in stadial times is largely reduced, but hot-spots exist in the climate shadows of large topographic features.},

abstractNote={The exploitation of osseous materials is one of the main innovations associated with the advent of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. The concept of the Aurignacian, as defined by Abbé Breuil, was used for a long time as a strong argument in favor of a cognitive revolution: its “sudden” appearance was linked to the rapid and systematic diffusion of the Aurignacian culture and the widespread distribution of split-based points in Europe, and upheld the idea of a clear biological and conceptual rupture with the Middle Paleolithic. Since then, several factors have contributed to undermining this model. Renewed studies of Aurignacian osseous technology in Western Europe contribute to the ongoing redefinition of the mechanisms behind the construction of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. Early Aurignacian osseous production was by no means limited to split-based points, and involved a wide variety of activities. The production of the different materials was already well structured and centered around three main spheres: reindeer antlers were mainly used for weapons, bone for the fabrication of domestic equipment and ivory was mostly reserved for ornaments. Although osseous technology was identified in some “transitional” groups, it spread and was durably integrated into techno-economical systems during the Aurignacian. It developed gradually in Europe and based on currently available knowledge, appears to have emerged in the Protoaurignacian societies of Western Europe. The emergence of this new technical domain seems to result from the transfer of wood working techniques to osseous materials, undoubtedly partly linked to a sudden shift in environmental conditions in Europe around 40000 BP. The evolution of osseous production during the course of the first phases of the Aurignacian provides evidence of profound techno-economic changes, which, backed up by data from lithic studies, reveals powerful sociological changes during the transition between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic.},

DOI={10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.11.015}, 
abstractNote={This paper evaluates the evidence for millennial-scale variability in pollen records of the last glacial (Marine Isotope Stages 4, 3, and 2; 73.5–14.7 calendar ka BP) from the European continent, taking into account information derived from long, continuous terrestrial records, the fragmentary northern European terrestrial record, and marine pollen records of the European continental margins. Pollen records from these numerous European sites provide evidence for multiple intervals of relatively warm and humid conditions during the last glacial, which promoted the establishment of grassland and shrub tundra in northwestern Europe, shrub- and forest-tundra in northeastern Europe, open boreal forest in central western Europe and the Alpine region, and open temperate forest in southern Europe. The northern limit for temperate forest development during these intervals was at ∼45°N, with a subsequent northward transition to tundra across a latitudinal band of ∼15° in western and central Europe, and a greater northward extension of boreal forest in eastern Europe, with boreal forest elements detected close to their present-day limits at ∼70°N. A much smaller number of sites with sufficiently high temporal resolution provide evidence that warming intervals correspond to millennial-scale variability as recorded in Greenland ice cores. A synthesis of sites providing high-resolution terrestrial and marine records from Europe is undertaken in order to examine geographical and temporal patterns in the expression of Dansgaard–Oeschger (D–O) cycles in the European vegetation. Detailed comparison of temperate forest development at these sites during four specific D–O cycles (D–O 16–17, 14, 12 and 8) reveals contrasts between vegetation response at southernmost European latitudes (below 40°N) and at latitudes above 40°N. At southernmost latitudes, marked forest development occurred during all four D–O cycles including D–O 16–17 and 8, while at latitudes above 40°N, forest development was stronger during D–O 14 and 12 than either D–O 16–17 or 8.},

Here, we provide a reconstruction of the human dispersal during the Aurignacian on the pan-European scale using a human dispersal model, the Our Way Model, which combines archaeological with paleoclimate data and uses the human existence potential as a unifying driver of human population dynamics. Based on the reconstruction, we identify the different stages of the human dispersal and analyse how human demographic processes are influenced by climate change and topography. A chronology of the Aurignacian human groups in Europe is provided, which is verified for locations where archaeological dating records are available.

 abstract = {It is a common assumption that an aggregation-and-dispersion pattern characterizes most of the world's hunter-gatherers, both past and present. A clarification of the pattern is put forth in support of the view that there is more to it than factors of subsistence ecology. Because there are many variants of hunter-gatherer aggregations, in terms of both activities and the factors that promote and effect them, it is clear that there will also be variation in their duration, location, cyclicity, and extent and the number and kinds of personnel involved. The implications of this variability for archeologists are discussed, and the need for establishing specific archeological test implications for the identification of each variant of prehistoric aggregation sites is emphasized. Data from one hypothesized aggregation locale, the Early Magdalenian site of Altamira (Cantabria, Spain), are drawn upon for a better understanding of the kinds of analytical questions we must frame and the kinds of data and analysis we need in the attempt to identify aggregation sites. Specifically, the analysis of engraved Magdalenian bones and antlers is expected to add to extant interpretations of Magdalenian site utilization based on regional faunal and lithic data. Specific test implications are set forth for the view that the Altamira engraved bone-and-antler assemblage was generated by engraving activities different from but related to those of otherwise dispersed engravers or bearers of the portable engraved materials. It is shown that indeed the diversity of engravings at Altamira is statistically greater than at any of the other Early Magdalenian sites studied. Further, although aspects of the design system are present everywhere, there are certain features that are unique to the hypothesized aggregation site and insignificantly few other features that are found elsewhere if lacking at Altamira. The demonstrable diversity of the Altamira engraving repertoire is supportive of the hypothesis that otherwise dispersed engravers contributed to the engravings at Altamira, which may well have been concomitant with a social aggregation of some size and extent.},

volume={60},
DOI={10.1086/701523}, 
abstractNote={In both Southwest Asia and Europe, only a handful of known Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic sites attest to aggregation or gatherings of hunter-gatherer groups, sometimes including evidence of hut structures and highly structured use of space. Interpretation of these structures ranges greatly, from mere ephemeral shelters to places “built” into a landscape with meanings beyond refuge from the elements. One might argue that this ambiguity stems from a largely functional interpretation of shelters that is embodied in the very terminology we use to describe them in comparison to the homes of later farming communities: mobile hunter-gatherers build and occupy huts that can form campsites, whereas sedentary farmers occupy houses or homes that form communities. Here we examine some of the evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic structures in Europe and Southwest Asia, offering insights into their complex “functions” and examining perceptions of space among hunter-gatherer communities. We do this through examination of two contemporary, yet geographically and culturally distinct, examples: Upper Paleolithic (especially Magdalenian) evidence in Western Europe and the Epipaleolithic record (especially Early and Middle phases) in Southwest Asia. A comparison of recent evidence for hut structures from these regions suggests several similarities in the nature of these structures, their association with activities related to hunter-gatherer aggregation, and their being “homes” imbued with quotidian and symbolic meaning.},

Numerous new/ongoing excavations, radiometric dating assays, paleoenvironmental, artifact and faunal analyses are summarized here and their implications for understanding the Middle–Upper Paleolithic transition and the succession of anatomically modern human adaptations in this narrow, mid-latitude strip bounded to the north by the Gulf of Gascony and to the south by the Cantabrian Cordillera. Constants in this record are the balance between regionally distinctive characteristics (in terms of ecology, faunas, artifacts, subsistence and art) and the reality of connections to the Upper Paleolithic cultures of France and the rest of Iberia; the role of the region as a glacial-age refugium; the fundamental continuity of human settlement with movements between the coastal lowlands and the adjacent montane interior; the intensification of subsistence through situational specialization and overall diversification, with periods of intensive demographic and environmental stress; underlying facts of lithology and the differential availability and utilization of flints and non-flint raw materials for different types of tools; the demographically critical role of intra- and extra-regional social networks within the context of valley-defined local band territories. The review proceeds along the lines of traditionally defined cultural traditions: Aurignacian sensu lato, Gravettian, Solultrean, Magdalenian and Azilian, although it is recognized that these are archeological constructs and that there is both considerable variability within each of these concepts and a considerable degree of similarity cross-cutting all of them.},

Recent archeological and ethnonhistorical research, however, has challenged this picture of long-term socioeconomic and demographic stability. The traditional viewpoint has been strongly influenced by models drawn from ecological and systemic schools of thought and, in this regard, Australian prehistory has much in common with hunter–gatherer studies elsewhere. These approaches have come under strong criticism indicating, among other things, that while such models help in describing the operation of cultural processes, they prove less satisfactory in providing explanation for change. The traditional Australian paradigm, which has emphasized socioeconomic and demographic stability, has had its most influential proponents in Birdsell. The occupation of the Australian continent, including all its inhabitable environments, is depicted in this account as a rapid process.

In this paper, we built an agent-based model simulation to clarify the mechanism by which anatomically modern humans expanded their social relationships in the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. The model predicts that most individuals or groups changed their learning strategies from “forager learning” to “collector learning” when anatomically modern humans expanded into Europe and became less likely to encounter one another due to residential moves, whereas a few agents specialized in “attractor learning.” “Attractors” become the hub of a social network in which various agents were linked, thus promoting accelerated cultural accumulation. This paper sheds light on the model to examine the appearance of a full range of “modern” behavioral traits by focusing on the effects of a social group’s characteristics.},

title={Human-Material Interaction in the Aurignacian of Europe, 35,000-27,000 BP: An Analysis of Marine Shell Ornament Distribution}, 
abstractNote={The Aurignacian period (35,000-27,000 BP) is the earliest phase of human occupation in the European Upper Paleolithic. As early inhabitants moved across the landscape they came into contact with others and left behind material traces of these interactions. Ornaments, or beads and pendants, made from marine shells are found in large numbers in Aurignacian assemblages. These objects are particularly useful for exploring the circulation of people and materials, as their presence far from the sea can be indicative of dynamic interactions between materials, individuals, and groups. This research explores the processes of human-material interactions during the Aurignacian based on the shapes of marine shells used as ornaments. More specifically, a network analysis is used to determine whether there are discernible patterns in the geographic distribution of marine shell shapes used for the creation of ornaments. Through the use of a social network analysis software called Gephi, this research visually maps the interactions between sites and regions during the Aurignacian. By creating network visualizations that are analyzed mathematically, in addition to geographic maps of site locations, patterns in the interactions within which materials and people were entangled are explored. Engaging with theories of materiality and material affordances (Conneller 2011; Gosden 2005; Malafouris 2013; Robb 2015; Wells 2008, 2012), this research sheds light on the active role of ornaments in the complex interactions between people and materials during the Aurignacian. The results support the notion that particular shapes of shells were preferentially selected and that some regions, such as the Dordogne of France, were important centers in the broader circulation of materials.},

ISSN={0277-3791}, 
DOI={https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.12.011}, 
abstractNote={The transition from the Middle Paleolithic (MP) to the Upper Paleolithic (UP), circa 40kya, is viewed as a major turning point in human evolution, in terms of the material culture, demography, and geographical expansion of modern humans. However, attempts to identify an origin of this so-called ‘revolution’ in the form of a particular stone-tool techno-complex, representing cultural modernity, which spread across the human range, have failed. Instead, the archaeological record of this period comprises multiple ‘transitional techno-complexes’, some associated with modern humans and others with Neanderthals. The cultures that these techno-complexes represent are characterized by precursors of the material cultures of the UP, often alongside features that suggest local cultural continuity. The broadly simultaneous appearance of these transitional cultures, despite a lack of a clear common origin, is puzzling. We suggest that these local ‘revolutions’ had a common underlying driver, which explains the simultaneous appearance of transitional techno-complexes, but that this driver did not determine the particular form of each local revolution. We propose that the driver of the transition to the UP was an increase in inter-population connectivity, both within- and between-species, which allowed local cultures to rapidly evolve and to attain greater complexity than ever before. We suggest that this change was driven by the interaction between modern humans and Neanderthals. In this article we outline processes that are likely to have influenced inter-population connectivity, bringing together evolutionary and ecological perspectives alongside insights from the field of cultural evolution.}, journal={Quaternary Science Reviews},

volume={14}, DOI={10.1098/rsif.2017.0171}, 
abstractNote={Evidence for interactions between populations plays a prominent role in the reconstruction of historical and prehistoric human dynamics; these interactions are usually interpreted to reflect cultural practices or demographic processes. The sharp increase in long-distance transportation of lithic material between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, for example, is seen as a manifestation of the cultural revolution that defined the transition between these epochs. Here, we propose that population interaction is not only a reflection of cultural change but also a potential driver of it. We explore the possible effects of inter-population migration on cultural evolution when migrating individuals possess core technological knowledge from their original population. Using a computational framework of cultural evolution that incorporates realistic aspects of human innovation processes, we show that migration can lead to a range of outcomes, including punctuated but transient increases in cultural complexity, an increase of cultural complexity to an elevated steady state and the emergence of a positive feedback loop that drives ongoing acceleration in cultural accumulation. Our findings suggest that population contact may have played a crucial role in the evolution of hominin cultures and propose explanations for observations of Palaeolithic cultural change whose interpretations have been hotly debated.},

The other two bodies of literature are that of the Meme position (Dawkins 1976, 1982, 1989, 1993; Ball 1984; Delius 1989, 1991; Moritz 1990; Heylighen 1992a,b) and that of the Inclusive Phenotype position (Dunnell 1980, 1989; Boyd and Richerson 1985; Leonard and Jones 1987, and see also this volume; Braun 1990; Durham 1990, 1991; O’Brien and Holland 1990, 1992; Cavalli-Sforza 1991; Neff 1992, 1993). The three positions have much in common, and are, of course, cultural phenomena themselves; each approach would advocate a Darwinian explanation for both its own emergence and that of its nearest philosophical relatives. CVT, for example, would characterize the recent proliferation and diversification of neo-Darwinian approaches as a cultural equivalent of the process whereby the first amphibious vertebrates colonized dry land; other phenomena, such as insects, were already there, but often not in direct competition. Selective metaphysics has colonized a new set of cultural niches, where no neo-Darwinian approaches existed before, namely, the cogni tive landscape of cultural and psychological fields of inquiry. They have spread so rapidly and so widely in modern academia, that, like butter spread over too much bread, the processes of founder effect, quasi-isolation, drift, and adaptive radiation have produced amazing symbolic diversity from very recent common cultural ancestors. In keeping with the principles of punctuated equilibria advanced by Eldredge and Gould (1972), small populations of ideas erratically distributed throughout the individual minds of partially isolated academic communities allow new concepts to become fixed in local traditions more easily. Such diversity is good. It allows the discovery of a wider range of interpretations, creating a pool of cultural selectionist ideas from which a clearer picture can emerge.},

abstractNote={We know that there are fundamental differences between humans and living apes, and also between living humans and their extinct relatives. It is also probably the case that the most significant and divergent of these differences relate to our social behaviour and its underlying cognition, as much as to fundamental differences in physiology, biochemistry or anatomy. In this paper, we first attempt to demarcate what are the principal differences between human and other societies in terms of social structure, organization and relationships, so that we can identify what derived features require explanation. We then consider the evidence of the archaeological and fossil record, to determine the most probable context in time and taxonomy, of these evolutionary trends. Finally, we attempt to link five major transitional points in hominin evolution to the selective context in which they occurred, and to use the principles of behavioural ecology to understand their ecological basis. Critical changes in human social organization relate to the development of a larger scale of fission and fusion; the development of a greater degree of nested substructures within the human community; and the development of intercommunity networks. The underlying model that we develop is that the evolution of ‘human society’ is underpinned by ecological factors, but these are influenced as much by technological and behavioural innovations as external environmental change.},

Personal decorations from mammoth tusk found at Mezmaiskaya suggest rare contacts between culture-unrelated Upper Palaeolithic groups in the North-western Caucasus and Russian plain. Recurrent obsidian procurement from two specific remote obsidian sources at Mezmaiskaya suggests that there were two well-established social networks between Upper Palaeolithic humans in the North-western Caucasus and related human groups in the North-central and South Caucasus. The evidence of obsidian transport from Mezmaiskaya outlines borders of the Upper Palaeolithic cultural area with similar human population and culture in the Caucasus, within wich the Upper Palaeolithic groups in the North and South Caucasus had regular social-cultural relations, including exchange of obsidian raw material. Finds of Black Sea marine shells and an azurite sandstone pebble at Mezmaiskaya are discussed as non-utilitarian objects derived from remote areas located on the paths of the two obsidian exchange networks that likely outline directions and limits of direct movements of Upper Palaeolithic humans from the North-western Caucasus.}, journal={Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports},

abstractNote={Here, the author presents a new perspective on the ways in which unique finds classified as personal ornaments in Early Upper Paleolithic collections from Siberia should be analyzed and interpreted. Such objects represent both a form of technological development and social communication. The specific features of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in southern Siberia include prolonged survival of Middle Paleolithic forms and convergence with the appearance and evolution of Aurignac-style elements. The general picture of the Initial and Early Upper Paleolithic in Siberia is a mosaic combination of stone reduction technologies, bone and antler processing, as well as an amazing variety of fossil materials representing various species within the genus Homo. Forms of modern symbolic behavior look rather stable in the archaeological context of the Early Upper Paleolithic of northern Eurasia between 40,000–50,000 years ago. This is especially true of personal ornaments, which constitute symbolic nominal systems. I suggest that forms, raw material, technologies, and types of personal ornaments in Siberian collections are not limited chronologically to the Early Upper Paleolithic, and were replicated later. Based on studies of various objects made during the Early Upper Paleolithic in Siberia, a preliminary classification is proposed, presented in the form of a typological table of features incorporating forms and techniques for manufacturing items of personal adornment.},

Using three different archaeological network datasets, we combine network slices from multiple periods to mimic the effects of time-averaging to understand how the palimpsest nature of the archaeological record affects our interpretations of the network. The results of our analysis indicate that time-averaging reduces the fidelity of network interpretations compared to the non-time-averaged networks when analyzing network or node properties. Our results also showed that the effects of time-averaging are highly dependent on initial network structures. This makes it difficult to establish general rules for how to interpret time-averaged networks in archaeology. However, our study shows that it is of paramount importance that archaeologists are aware of these biases and evaluate the reliability of their data accordingly.},

The emergence of complex adaptations among hunter–gatherers by the close of the Pleistocene is widely assumed. Those hunter–gatherers who occupied the classic region of southwestern Europe during the Upper Paleolithic are one of the most heralded examples. During the course of the Upper Paleolithic, social evolution has taken the path of ever-increasing elaboration and complexity. Most Paleolithic archeologists will readily admit that the standard measures of complexity (for example, increasing definition of space or territory) are still outside the scope of Upper Paleolithic archaeological resolution. This is just as much the case for those ecological, environmental, settlement, and subsistence variables that are usually considered more accessible to archeologists as it is for those considered less accessible such as hierarchic organization or information networks.},

First, a separate, full analysis for each type is required, in order to discern which among its array of distinctive institutions is generatively fundamental; it is upon this fundamental institution that the transformation is focused. Secondly, an examination of the principles of structuring exemplified in each type is needed; this permits the question of legitimacy relating to the transformation to be addressed. Finally, the cultural change which underpins the transformation should be explained. Three types of hunter-gatherer social structure are used - Eskimo/Bushman, Northwest Coast Indian and Australian. Particular attention is paid to the logic of the social structure among the Australian, and to revealing the contrasting principles of structuring that pertain to the three types. Eskimo/Bushman institutions are shown to be informed more by `information structuring’, whilst Northwest Coast Indian and Australian are informed more by `authority structuring’; in terms of legitimacy this is a radical difference.]},

abstractNote={Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the aspects of hunter–gatherer complexity. The archeology of hunter–gatherers has generally relied on rather simplistic models to describe preagricultural adaptations. A misplaced reliance upon ethnographically known groups has precluded an appreciation of the diversity of hunting–gathering adaptations. Foragers in more temperate and fertile areas of the world were replaced by farmers long before written documents recorded their way of life. Hunter–gatherers surviving to the ethnographic present do so in the most marginal areas of the planet. Cultural complexity, in the context of hunter–gatherer adaptations, is the major concern of this volume. Although a variety of terms—developed, advanced, elaborate, sophisticated—have been employed to describe this phenomenon, they are semantically weighted with a teleological notion of progress. Each of the above contributions emphasizes certain characteristics of increasing complexity. Intensification has been discussed in terms of a variety of factors: environment, resource availability, subsistence, sedentism, linear settlement, technology, storage, population, exchange, conflict, competition, social organization, territoriality, style, labor organization, craft specialization, inequality, and status differentiation.},

abstractNote={In this chapter Tilley outlines aspects of a general social theory which has implications for all archaeological processes – the use and deposition of material culture and its analysis and interpretation. The concern is to situate archaeology securely within the social sciences to which it can contribute positively as a discipline defined by a distinctive body of information.According to the theory presented, societies have a dual nature. They consist of individual people, but also of social structures. Individual acts are orientated according to principles or rules which in turn are reproduced by the actions. Man makes himself within a particular spatial and historical context in which he ‘knows how’ to act, even if he is unaware of all the structuring principles employed. Action has consequences (intended and unintended) which form the social structure.Material culture has a central role in the relationship between the individual and the social structure. Material items are structured according to principles or rules, but they also structure further individual actions as part of a particular ideological framework. Finally, the nature and causes of social change are considered and emphasis is placed on contradictions between the interests and orientations of individuals and groups within society.IntroductionThe position put forward here for an understanding of the nature of social formations and of changes within them is defined as dialectical structuralism.},

Recent archaeological results in the area, with evidence of increases in site numbers and artefact deposition rates and diversification of subsistence resources to include small-bodied species, show the development of new patterns of technology, economy and demography following major environmental changes in the post-Pleistocene period. Widespread changes in Australian prehistory around 4000 years ago may have been triggered in certain key areas such as South-east Queensland.},

Jewellery has always fascinated students of history, both professional and casual. One only has to observe museum visitors poring over display cases of ancient ornaments to notice how these items capture the modern imagination. The traditional and widespread view that these artefacts are purely decorative and somehow supplementary to the basic functioning of human society has shaped our interpretations of their roles in the past. Most often, personal ornaments are relegated to markers of wealth and social},

volume={158},
ISSN={0002-9483}, 
DOI={10.1002/ajpa.22832}, 
abstractNote={ABSTRACT Objectives Nineteenth and twentieth century documents testify that four ethnic groups, generally classified as terrestrial hunters or canoe nomads, inhabited Fuego-Patagonia. Archaeologically, however, their presence and temporal depth remains unknown. This study analyzes the antiquity and geographic distribution of cranial modification, a highly visible symbol of social identity, in Fuego-Patagonia, Chile, to assess whether it expressed ethnic affiliation. Materials and Methods A total of 60 adult skulls from Southern Patagonia (n?=?32; 53.3%) and Tierra del Fuego (n?=?28; 46.7%) were examined for age-at-death, sex and cranial modification with standard methods. Individuals were further categorized as terrestrial (n?=?26; 43.3%), marine (n?=?21; 35%) or indetermined hunter-gatherers (n?=?13; 21.7%) based on the archaeological site’s characteristics, geographic location, and isotopic information. Results Thirty percent (n?=?18) of the skulls in this study were modified, and most of the modified skulls (n?=?15) presented a tabular-erect shape. No statistically significant differences were identified between Fuegians and Patagonians, males or females, or between the different types of adaptation and geographic locations. Discussion Thus, this Late Holocene, widely distributed practice, was not a reflection of ethnicity, but a material expression of information circulation and the complex social relations that these small-size groups had with one another. These results suggest that the emergence of modern ethnic identities in the region is a historic process that resulted from the interaction of local groups with European and Criollos},
